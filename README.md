## PySimpleGUI based GUI to download all Springer books released for free during the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine

This repo has the code that dowhnloads the files:

https://github.com/alexgand/springer_free_books

It lacks a GUI and control of where to save the files which is what this new program provides.

## Using

Run the program `PSG_Download_Springer_Books.py`

You will be prompted for a folder to save the books to.  In that folder a subfolder named "springer_books" will be created.

Books will be downloaded to this subfolder and categorized by subject.

The books are organized according to the subject ("English Package Name" column).

If you want just one or two specific books, get the excel file from the folowing link and download the titles you seek:
